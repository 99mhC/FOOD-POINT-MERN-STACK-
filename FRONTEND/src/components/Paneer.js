        <h1>My Recipe</h1>
        <p>If you have never loved your paak paneer before it is most likely for the way you cooked it. Not anymore becouse my recipe will help you master cooking the perfect spinach paneer.</p>
        <p>Growing up we never liked palak paneer anywhere, even in the best restaurants for the way i9t tasted and looked. Later i always had a tough time getting even my toddlers to eat it in restaurants. After trying deffi=eresnt ways of making palak paneer I finally arrived at this version that is always and huge hit with everyone around.</p>
        <p>This palak paneer is the best,you are ever going to make. The best results are achieved just by not blanching your spinach and not overcooking it. So to avoid blanching we saute the spinach first and then puree.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about your palak paneer tasting bitter it won't really, becouse we clean ,saute the leaves until wilted and avoid overcooking similar to the way we do in a l9o9t of other recipes like dal palak, spinach paratha,palakrice,aloo palak and many more.</p>
        <p>A lot of people also ask it palak paneer and saag paneer are the same. I answer it here:</p>
        <h1>Palak Paneer vs Saag Paneer</h1>
        <p>Palak paneer is an authentic indian dish ori8ginated in india, while saag paneer is what ia invented by the chefs in indian restaurant abroad, outside india. We would usally never find daag paneer on any restaurant meny in india. BUt we do find saag paneer on any restaurant in india.  </p>
        <p>Since palak means spinach, palak paneer is made with spinach. But saag typically refers to many deffetnt greens like mustard greens,radish,fenugreek leaves and few other. So usally saag is made with any all of these. So it you order for a saag paneer in a restaurant,you are more likely to eat or all of these in it.</p>
        <p>These many different ways a saa paneer is made so it tastes totally different in every restaurant. The saag paneer i have eaten is made with spincach,coriader leaves and methi leaves which is far different from the palak paneer.</p>
